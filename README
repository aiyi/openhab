Simplified OpenHAB without OSGI.
===========

1. Import projects into Eclipse.
2. Set Classpath Variable 'OPENHAB_ROOT' in Preferences/Java/Build Path.
3. To make ServiceLoader happy in Eclipse, each module's dir should be included as classpath in Run Configurations. ServiceLoader will go through these paths to find the modules.
4. Add argument -Dconfigdir=${workspace_loc}/openhab/conf/main to specify the main configuration folder.
5. Run Core as Java application.
